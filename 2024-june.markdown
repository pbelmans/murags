### Speakers, titles and abstracts

**Pieter Belmans: A panorama of quiver moduli**
<a name="belmans"></a>

In this talk I will survey recent progress on the geometry of quiver moduli.
These moduli spaces of (semi)stable quiver representations
have many similarities with moduli spaces of vector bundles on curves,
provided that you approach them from the right perspective.
I will illustrate this dictionary between quivers and curves,
in order to motivate how these two types of moduli spaces behave
similarly from the point of view of
symmetries,
deformation theory,
derived categories,
stacky constructions,
Brauer groups,
rationality questions,
etc.
These similarities take on the form of analogies in the results,
but also in the ingredients of the proofs.
