**Lie Fu: Hyper-Kummer construction**
<a name="fu"></a>

Analogously to the classical construction of Kummer K3 surface from an abelian surface, S. Floccari discovered that any hyper-Kähler 6-fold of generalized Kummer type has a canonical action of a finite symplectic automorphism group such that the quotient admits a crepant resolution, which is a hyper-Kähler variety of K3[3]-type. In a joint work in progress with Floccari, we study various aspects of this "hyper-Kummer" construction. Our results include characterizations of the hyper-Kummer K3[3]-type variety in terms of lattices, relation between the derived categories and algebraic cycles (motives) of the hyper-Kummer 6-folds and the original generalized Kummer-type hyper-Kähler 6-folds. We especially highlight the rich geometry in this construction that many canonically associated hyper-Kähler 4-folds and K3 surfaces emerge and interact interestingly.
